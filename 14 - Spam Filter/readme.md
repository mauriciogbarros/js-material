Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions. It provides a brief overview of each syntax element.

## Array.prototype.some()
Tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns true if, in the array, it finds an element for which the provided function returns true; otherwise it returns false. It doesn't modify the array.

```
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Checks whether an element is even
const even = (element) => element % 2 === 0;

console.log(array.some(even));
// Expected output: true
```

## Character classes
Character classes distinguish kinds of characters such as, for example, distinguishing between letters and digits.

```
const chessStory = 'He played the King in a8 and she moved her Queen in c2.';
const regexpCoordinates = /\w\d/g;
console.log(chessStory.match(regexpCoordinates));
// Expected output: Array [ 'a8', 'c2']

const moods = 'happy ðŸ™‚, confused ðŸ˜•, sad ðŸ˜¢';
const regexpEmoticons = /[\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}]/gu;
console.log(moods.match(regexpEmoticons));
// Expected output: Array ['ðŸ™‚', 'ðŸ˜•', 'ðŸ˜¢']
```
